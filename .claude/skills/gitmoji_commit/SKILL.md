# Gitmoji Commit Skill

This Skill automates the Git commit process. You will analyze code changes and current conversation context (user instructions and your modifications) to generate a commit message following the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) specification.

## Core Principles
1.  **Always use ENGLISH** for the commit Subject and Body.
2.  **STRICTLY NO PUSHING (`git push`)**, only execute local commits (`git commit`).
3.  **Formatting Standard**: `<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    * **Emoji**: Use the Gitmoji code (e.g., `:sparkles:`) for better terminal compatibility, rather than the raw Unicode character.
    * **Subject**: A concise English description, starting with an imperative verb (e.g., Add, Fix, Update), limited to 50 characters. This acts as the first `-m` title.
    * **Body (Optional)**: **Strongly recommend using a single `-m` parameter** unless the commit involves massive, multi-layered changes where the title alone cannot convey the core intent. If the `Subject` sufficiently summarizes the intent, keep it simple.
    * *Example (Default/Concise)*: `git commit -m ":sparkles: feat(auth): add user login functionality"`
    * *Example (Complex/Split)*: `git commit -m ":bug: fix(nav): resolve navbar alignment issue" -m "1. Fix margin calculation bug on mobile\n2. Standardize z-index for glassmorphism components"`

## Execution Steps

### 1. Check Staging Area
First, verify if there are any staged files:
```powershell
git diff --cached --name-only
```
* **If empty**: Prompt the user: "The staging area is empty. Please stage your files using `git add` first," and halt execution.
* **If staged files exist**: Proceed to the next step.

### 2. Analyze Changes & Context
Run `git diff --cached` to get the detailed diff. You **MUST** review the current conversation history:
- What did the user just request?
- What are the specific code changes?
- If there are multiple changes, what is the **primary intent**? (e.g., If a script was built and a minor typo was fixed, prioritize the script build. By default, generate a single commit capturing the primary intent).

### 3. Generate Commit Message
Select the **most accurate** Emoji and Type from the reference table based on your analysis.

### 4. User Interaction & Execution
You **MUST** display the proposed commit command to the user and request confirmation first.

**Example Conversation**:
> **Agent**: The staging area contains dependency updates in `package.json`.
> Proposed commit message:
> `git commit -m ":arrow_up: chore(deps): upgrade vue version to 3.4"`
>
> Shall I execute this?

**ONLY after the user explicitly replies with "Yes", "Confirm", "OK", etc.,** proceed to run the command:
```powershell
# Simple Commit
git commit -m ":your-emoji: type(scope): subject"

# Complex Commit
git commit -m ":your-emoji: type(scope): subject" -m "1. Detail one\n2. Detail two"
```

## Important Notes
- If the user is unsatisfied with the proposed message, adjust it based on their feedback and ask for confirmation again.
- Once successfully committed, inform the user and remind them to manually push the changes.
